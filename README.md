Community Center Budget

Hi,

I am a developer, developing a 55+ community with 9,000 units. 

A 28,000-sf community center with many amenities will be at the center of it all. 

My sales pitch in selling all 9,000 units depends on having a software that will keep track of the community centerâ€™s budget.

Instructions will include:

Building an expense ledger with vender info, cause, sub-cause, payment info and the satisfaction rate per vender.

Good luck!
