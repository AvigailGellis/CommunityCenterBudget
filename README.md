# 55+ Community Center Budget

Hi,

I am a developer, developing a 55+ community with 9,000 units. 

A 28,000-sf community center with many amenities will be at the center of it all. 

My sales pitch in selling all 9,000 units depends on having a software that will keep track of the community centerâ€™s budget.

## Instructions will include

Building an expense ledger with:
- Vender info
- Cause
- Sub-cause
- Payment info
- Satisfaction rate per vender.

## Spec

The full spec is a file included in the repo, called spec.sql.

## Deliverables
The four below files are required for this repo:
1. Database
2. Table
3. Data
4. Reports

## SQL requirements
- Primary key
- Properly named columns
- Proper data types
- Not Null as appropiate
- Constraints
- Include drop and use statements in the database and table files

##### Good luck!
